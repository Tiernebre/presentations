A collection of Vue and React components that have **ZERO** opinions on styling, but give
you re-usable logic for common UI widgets and components.

## Overview

- HeadlessUI is a library that contains a bunch of useful widgets that do not have opinions on styling. This is VERY useful if you've run into situations like I have where you're sometimes fighting against a specific framework implementation of a UI pattern.
- All the HeadlessUI components are A11y (accessibility) polished, and help _encourage_ good accessibility practices out of the box.
- You can use ANY CSS framework or library with it, or style it based on the Figma prototype a designer gives you. You as a developer are only concerned with styling the component!
