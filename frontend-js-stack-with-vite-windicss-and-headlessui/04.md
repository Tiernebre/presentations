# Vitest

Vitest is a test runner built for Vite and uses Vite compilation under the hood
to make your tests _wicked fast_ to run and develop with.

## tl;dr about test runners

A test runner is a tool used to run the tests you write in your code. In the JavaScript
ecosystem, you may have heard of tools such as Jest, Karma, Mocha, or Ava. Vitest is just the
"Vite" flavored version of a framework like these!

### Jest... but for Vite!

- The Vitest API is _nearly_ 1:1 with the Jest API, thus I've been referring to it as the Vite version of Jest. It's actually faster than Jest. Benchmarks below are sourced from Matti Bar-Zeev's article on Vitest (https://dev.to/mbarzeev/from-jest-to-vitest-migration-and-benchmark-23pl):


| Framework   | Initial Run | Watch Run |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Jest        | 6.50s       | 5.5s      |
| Vitest      | 5.30s       | 1.25s     |

- Besides speed, it's just plain easier to run tests using Vitest than Jest with a Vite based build environment. You need to otherwise delve deep into the Jest configuration ecosystem and wire it up yourself, Vitest is highly suggested if you're sold on Vite as a build tool.
