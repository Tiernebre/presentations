# What This Talk Will Go Over

These are some technologies that I have been leveraging in recent
personal projects that have made web development easier and faster
than ever!

The goal of this talk is to introduce some cool tech libraries I've used recently
that I've felt have made my development life easier and more fun. This talk will have
data points, but I'll be providing my own anecdotal experiences on these technologies :) .

I will be taking a high level overview of each of the following technologies,
and at the end I hope to showcase a live demo of a web app that integrates all
of these and show what the development experience is like with all of these tools
combined together!

Also worth noting: these tools are **mostly cross framework compatible** (Vite isn't Angular compatible, Headless UI is only for React + Vue)! And they are not
coupled to each other. You can pick and choose which ones you like the most from this talk
without needing to couple it to another one.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/)
- [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev/)
