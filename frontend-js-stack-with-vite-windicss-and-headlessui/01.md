# What This Talk Will Go Over

These are some technologies that I have been leveraging in recent
personal projects that have made web development easier and faster
than ever!

I will be taking a high level overview of each of the following technologies,
and at the end I hope to showcase a live demo of a web app that integrates all
of these and show what the development experience is like with all of these tools
combined together!

Also worth noting: these tools are **mostly cross framework compatible** (Vite isn't Angular compatible, Headless UI is only for React + Vue)! And they are not
coupled to each other. You can pick and choose which ones you like the most from this talk
without needing to couple it to another one.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/)
- [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev/)
