# Why and Why Not Vite? ðŸ¤”

## Pros

- Wicked fast build times for production and local development builds (with nearly instant code refreshes).
- Uses modern tooling under the hood for you to support the future standards of JavaScript bundling (ESM - ES Modules)
- Fantastic out-of-the-box configuration and plugin tooling ecosystem. [First class support for server side rendered applications as well](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html).

## Cons

- Because it uses modern tooling, it does not work for Internet Explorer or other older browsers.
- Webpack and other bundling tools have been in the ecosystem longer, therefore there's more docs and guidance around it. In addition to fixing and solving a lot of edge case, niche situations that can sometimes come up in web development.
